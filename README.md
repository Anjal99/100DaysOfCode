# BlackJack
This game is developed in Python as part of my #100DaysOfCode challenge that I have recently taken up.

# About the Game
Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos around the world. The objective of the game is to have a hand with a total value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards and involves players competing against the dealer rather than against each other. The game involves a combination of luck and skill, as players need to make strategic decisions about when to hit, stand, double down or split their cards based on their hand and the dealer's face-up card.

# Break down
The deck is unlimited in size. There are no jokers. All your Face cards (Jack/Queen/King) all count as 10 and the Ace can count as 11 or 1. The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn. The cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn and you will be playing against the computer who is going to be the dealer.
