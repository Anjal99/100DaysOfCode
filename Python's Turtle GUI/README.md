### Turtle GUI in Python

Python has an in-built library called Turtle that lets you develop basic graphic games and art using pre existing methods.

With 2 main classes Turtle() and the Screen(), you can control a variety of objects like color, coordinate systems, and movements. This versatile library can be tweak to create some classic games within python. 

This is my attempt to develop a few old classics using Turtle Graphics and Object Oriented Programming within Python.

### Snake Game
A representation of what the Nokia keypad phones debut in the early 90's with a pixeled snake and a piece of food. The goal was to move the snake and consume food which would increase the size of the snake without hitting the boundaries or the snake itself.
