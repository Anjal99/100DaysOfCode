## A sample Non-GUI Coffee Dispencer 

This code contains 2 separate files -
1) coffee.py -> this stores the menu, coffee resources, and ingredients required to make the coffee
2) main.py -> this is where the housing of our logic is set.

This program prompts the user to chose a drink from the available menu options. Once the drink is
chosen, the user is prompted to insert the payment in American coins. Then the payment is verified
and the drink is dispensed if the amount meets the requirements. The machine is also capable of
dispencing change as well as running through the inventory for a report on the available resources
